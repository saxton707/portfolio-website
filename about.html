                        <p>
                            Art has always existed in my life in many capacities. It has been my relief, my greatest struggle, my best friend, my therapist and now my official partner in crime. I originally planned to go to school for
                            illustration seeing as I could focus on any task in school until the entire sidebar of my page was filled with countless doodles. It wasn’t until high-school that I realized that I thought far more analytically
                            than the realm of traditional art demands and that is when I transitioned into the wonderous world of Graphic Design.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I pursued Graphic Design through Niagara College for a 3 year program and absolutely fell in love with the skill. I was whole-heartedly invested in learning as much as I could digest and creating as much as I
                            could conceptualize. I graduated from my program with Presidential Honours and a full time job as a Junior Graphic Designer. I worked at that job for months utilizing the best learning tool for any human; real
                            life experience. I continued to do the work but slowly the excitement of just landing a job faded and I was left with a job that didn’t provide any fulfillment. So I decided to open myself to the world of
                            Freelance Design.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thus the birth of my current standing design title: “Oddish Studio”. I chose Oddish because I have always looked at the world through a very unique lens. I apprecaited the quirks, glitches, unanswerable, odd
                            parts of life. I was drawn to them. I enjoy the risk and adrenaline of not walking along the beaten path and I wanted to hone that in my career. Freelancing was one of the most difficult but rewarding jobs I have
                            ever had.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Throughout all of my education I was fascinated with web design; the layouts, interactivty, user based content and sheer complication amazed me. That’s when I found myself searching for any way to learn more
                            about UI and Web design as I possibly could until I stumbled upon CareerFoundry’s UI Course. I immediately enrolled and fell even more in love with this industry and began the cycle of learning and creating once
                            more. I have used this time and effort within learning institutions and out in the real world to better myself as a designer and person every single day. Not a day goes by where I don’t appreciate the journey I
                            have taken or look forward in excitement for what the industry and my future may have in store. I couldn’t be more excited to continue.
