                <h1> Kredit Financial App </h1>
                <p class="description"> Kredit exists to help people save money. Financial accounts and habits can be an uncomfortable conversation topic but with Kredit, it doesn’t have to be. Kredit is here to replace any anxiety that may exist with money and change that into comfort and confidence. </p>
            </div>



            <div>
                <h3> Concept </h3>
                <p> When tasked with creating a financial app that allows users to save money for big purchases I knew the exact style that I was going to use. With a history in graphic design and traditional art it there comes a thorough understanding of how the shapes and colours of a design can affect the user. Kredit needed to be friendly, calm and reliable. </p>
            </div>

            <br>

            <div>
                <h3> Branding & Style </h3>
                <p>  To embrace the “Friendly” feeling Kredit needed to utilize rounded shapes and corners to be less confrontational. “Calm” had to come from using a large amount of white spacing within the layout and pairing that with a calm, simplified, colour palette like accents of blue on white. Finally the “Reliable” is a bit trickier but the use of bolded strong fonts through Kredit do create a sense of reliability along with it primarily grided structure. Nothin in Kredit acts independently from the grid as to avoid creating any sense of anxiety or uncertainty for the user. </p>
            </div>

            <br>

           
            <div>
                <h3> Wireframes </h3>
                <p>   Kredit from the very conception was designed to embrace a simple one colour design and focused heavily on giving information the room to digest and provide a sense of calm. The app needed to embrace and combat the stress and complications that come with finances. </p>
            </div>

                    <h3> User Flow </h3>
                    <p> Kredit offers a number of functions but there is a fine balance between offering the user plenty of functions and burdening the user with too many choices or options. Kredit has everything and nothing more than what you need at the same time. </p>
                </picture>

            <div>
                <h3> Final Screens </h3>
                <p>  Kredit needed to, more than anything, provide a great sense of unity between it’s screens. When handling sensitive information such as financial accounts and history the user should never feel like they left the comfort of the app and it’s confidentiality/security. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3> Extra Screens </h3>
                <p>  Kredit offers a number of options to the user and every function offers a level of customization to tailor the complicated process of saving money and tracking financial statistics to their liking. </p>
